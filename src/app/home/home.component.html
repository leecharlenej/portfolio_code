                Hi (: I'm Charlene, a former Math educator turned tech enthusiast. As a kid, I loved playing with HTML and Photoshop, but life led me to pursue Math as a junior college lecturer. Tech was always on my mind, though, so when the chance to join a cybersecurity traineeship arose, I jumped at it. My 1.5 years as a Cybersecurity Engineer at a local bank opened my eyes to the power of automation â€” I taught myself VBA and macros to streamline tedious tasks, cutting admin work in half.
                <br><br>
                Now, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computing at NUS, diving deeper into the world of tech. This website is my space to explore Angular and showcase my projects. I hope you enjoy looking around, and I'd love to connect with you <a class="text-secondary" routerLink="/contact" routerLinkActive="text-dark">here</a>.
